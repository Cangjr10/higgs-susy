higgs-susy
==========

This project contains python code to replicate the results in the publication 

Baldi, P., P. Sadowski, and D. Whiteson. “Searching for Exotic Particles in High-energy Physics with Deep Learning.” Nature Communications 5 (July 2, 2014).

Note: Due to an old bug in the Pylearn2 termination_criteria module, the deep models were trained for ~1000 epochs. The models here may terminate training after only ~200 epochs, in which case the termination criteria should be changed to train for the full 1000 epochs to get the same results in the paper. 

Additional Requirements:

1) The HIGGS and SUSY datasets available from the UCI ML Repository

2) Pylearn2 and Theano
